Baseball Simulator!

By Brendan (BronyPhysicist)


Right now the functionality is very limited. Only things that work fully are the Calendar and Scheduling packages. More to come as I get time.

Latest change (2017/04/02)
-Added functionality for generating certain essential stats of players at random.
-Refactored calendar package for easier importation.
-Added calendar functionality to quickly count dates between years.
